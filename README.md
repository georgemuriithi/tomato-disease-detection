# Tomato Disease Detection
This is an end to end project that involves image classification. A CNN model is trained to classify tomato leaves according to 7 common tomato diseases and healthy tomato plants.

The model is then deployed locally using `Docker` and remotely using `Google Cloud Platform`. To access the model, a web page is created using `React JS` and an Android mobile application is created using `React Native`.
